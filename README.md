# The Division vs. Diversity of NYC High Schools

The New York City public school system is the largest school system in the United States which assists more 
than one million students spread throughout the 32 districts in all five bouroughs of the city. The 
Department of Education (DOE) is the department responsible for managing the city's school system.
The DOE is committed to creating and supporting learning environments that reflect the diversity 
of NYC. 

According to the DOE, diversity comes in many forms which include racial background, socioeconomic status,
housing status, life experience, and ability to name a few. To improve diversity, the DOE has implemented 
a diversity plan which includes several policy changes that would assist the topic at hand; this plan 
builds on everyday work and collaboration with partners to make public schools strong and welcoming. 

It has been mentioned in several articles that the public school system is very divisive and that actions 
must be taken to resolve this issue. It would be great to present data that drives home this problem and gives some 
insight as to how the DOE's mission is coinciding to help our children.

# 1. SAT Score Performance 

![First Visual](https://github.com/ElvinGranados/Side-Project-2-/blob/master/Visuals/Visual1.png)

Throughout the city, the average score on the SAT is around 1200 for most schools. We note the cluster 
of poor performing schools in the lower Manhattan, South Bronx, and East Brooklyn regions. There are also 
very few schools scattered around that have an average SAT performance of 1900+. These are the specialized 
high schools which cater to the most academically gifted children and require an exam to gain admission.

The DOE is working on a proposal which would make admissions to these schools more equitable and increase diversity; this 
includes using multiple factors to determine offers, expanding the Diversity Program to help disadvantaged students, and 
phase out the SHSAT exam itself so that the majority of offers are given to the top percentage of students at each school. 

# 2. SAT Distribution By Race

The scatterplots show the racial distribution of every school in NYC and the performance on the SAT. From the data,there is a positive correlation between test performance and the White/Asian percentages of a school whereas the opposite is observed where the Black/Hispanic percentages of a school result in lower test scores. This illustrates the current issue with the diversity of these schools and the apparent division within the system. Unfortunately, the necessary evil to compare students won't go away anytime soon as  colleges and universities need a way to measure the success of their future admittants using standardized tests as a metric. 

# 3. Visualization Of The Correlation

![Third Visual](https://github.com/ElvinGranados/Side-Project-2-/blob/master/Visuals/Visual4.png)

Here we are presented with the correlation matrix to show the strength of relation between these variables. There are moderately strong relationships between standardized test scores and the demographic percentages of a school that match the observations from the scatterplots. From the DOE proposal, approximately 74% of current offers to SHS are given to Whites/Asians while only 9% are given to Hispanics/Blacks. In contrast, the citywide racial demographic approximates Blacks/Hispanics to make up 70% of the population; the DOE's proposal to hand offers to the top performing students of each school would rearrange the racial demographic to match that of the entire city. 

# 4. Neighborhood Imbalances 

![Fourth Visual](https://github.com/ElvinGranados/Side-Project-2-/blob/master/Visuals/Visual2.png)

The scattermap shows the 50 most populous neighborhoods in the city and the median household income earned in these areas. The lowest earning neighborhoods cover the area of schools that obtained the lowest test scores. From this observation, these students come from a lower socioeconomical status and are a target demographic the DOE is currently trying to assist through their programs. Given that standardized test preparation classes offered by companies such as The Princeton Review and Kaplan can range from $75-$1000, these are expenses some families unfortunately cannot afford and results in their children receiving a disadvantage 

# 5. Average Household Incomes vs. Location 

![Fifth Visual](https://github.com/ElvinGranados/Side-Project-2-/blob/master/Visuals/Visual3.png)

With the median income being as low as $23000 annually in Mott Haven, there is a clear difference between families living in low SES areas versus those families living in affluent neighborhoods such as the Upper East Side averaging around $132000 annually. The lowest earning neighborhoods are all kocated in the Bronx in close vicinity of each other. 

# Discussion

Unfortunately, for a very diverse city, the educational system is quite divisive just from observing scores and income. These
lower performing schools are from lower SES neighborhoods where the income is as low as $12000 annually. The neighborhoods contain poor housing conditions, drug/crime activity and an environment where its inhabitants don't feel secure and thus priorites to flourish are not present. From prior social research, it's also been shown that white and asian households have been taught goal orientation, to grab opportunities when present and the value of hardwork from prior generations which are factors outside of school that already assist students towards the path to success. This is not to say that the hispanic and black demographics are not capable of success; there are already charter schools such as the Kipp Academy and Success Academy that push their students to appreciate the value of hardwork and strive for their future success. Strict scheduling, hours of homework, fast paced learning starting from grade school are techniques these prepatory programs have implemented. Starting in 2016, the SAT itself was revised to test students on more relevant material that has been taught in schools and would not give students who could afford the expensive courses such an advantage. 

Although not shown in the visuals according to research from The Center for Epidemiologic Studies, income distribution measured by the GINI coefficient and neighborhood income may be determinants to explain substance abuse which would also have an adverse effect on the success of students. There is already research showing that unsafe neighborhoods can increase psychological stress and drugs are used as coping mechanisms. In addition, social and psychological resources are not readily avaiable which results in limited assistance in dealing with stress and at individual-levels proving difficult to overcome substance usage. 

Data visualization can be a very powerful tool that helps to see the bigger picture and allow mindful decisions to be made to the benefit of others!
