# The Division vs. Diversity of NYC High Schools

The New York City public school system is the largest school system in the United States which assists more 
than one million students spread throughout the 32 districts in all five bouroughs of the city. The 
Department of Education (DOE) is the department responsible for managing the city's school system.
The DOE is committed to creating and supporting learning environments that reflect the diversity 
of NYC. 

According to the DOE, diversity comes in many forms which include racial background, socioeconomic status,
housing status, life experience, and ability to name a few. To improve diversity, the DOE has implemented 
a diversity plan which includes several policy changes that would assist the topic at hand; this plan 
builds on everyday work and collaboration with partners to make public schools strong and welcoming. 

It has been mentioned in several articles that the public school system is very divisive and that actions 
must be taken to resolve this issue. It would be great to present data that drives home this problem and gives some 
insight as to how the DOE's mission is coinciding to help our children.

# 1. SAT Score Performance

Throughout the city, the average score on the SAT is around 1200 for most schools. We note the cluster 
of poor performing schools in the lower Manhattan, South Bronx, and East Brooklyn regions. There are also 
very few schools scattered around that have an average SAT performance of 1900+. These are the specialized 
high schools which cater to the most academically gifted children and require an exam to gain admission.

The DOE is working on a proposal which would make admissions to these schools more equitable and increase diversity; this 
includes using multiple factors to determine offers, expanding the Diversity Program to help disadvantaged students, and 
phase out the SHSAT exam itself so that the majority of offers are given to the top percentage of students at each school. 

# 2. SAT Distribution By Race

Looking more closely, we can observe the racial distribution of every school in NYC and the performance on the SAT. From the data,
there is a positive correlation between test performance and the White/Asian percentages of a school whereas the opposite is observed
where the Black/Hispanic percentages of a school result in lower test scores. This illustrates the current issue with the diversity of these schools and the apparent division within the system. Unfortunately, the necessary evil to compare students won't go
away anytime soon and colleges/universities need a way to measure the success of their future admittants using standardized tests as 
a metric.
