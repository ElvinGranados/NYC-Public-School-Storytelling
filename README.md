# Side-Project-2-
This project focuses on NYC Public Schools and uses data visualization to tell a story! Please feel free to take a look and 
leave any comments!

What I've done is looked at NYC Public High Schools and wanted to do some story-telling from the data I collected. 
I obtained SAT scores from 2012 as well as the demographics of each schools and wanted to figure out if there were any relationships 
to look at. To make it more appealling, I also used a geo toolkit to map out these observations using the coordinates of these schools 
to figure out the distribution of performance around the city. I also obtained information on the neighborhoods around the city and 
considered income to be a factor in a school's performance.
